# Pothole_detection_model_approach<br>
The aim is to detect whether an image contains potholes or not. <br>
The final approach used is transfer learning ResNet50 with model fine tunning and hyper parameter tunning. <br>
the metrics used to calculate it are accuracy and F1 score with an accuracy of 98%. <br>
